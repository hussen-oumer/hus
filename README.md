# Hussen Oumer Mohammed

## Biography
I am a computational physicist and PhD candidate at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). My research focuses on **thermoresponsive ionic liquids**, **IL/water phase behavior**, and **soft matter systems**, using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and advanced analysis workflows in Python.

I routinely works on HPC clusters (SLURM), studies LCST/UCST behavior in ionic liquid/water mixtures, and explores how molecular-level structure and interactions give rise to emergent phase behavior. My broader interests include **energy and battery materials**, **reproducible computational workflows**, and **scientific software for molecular simulations**.
